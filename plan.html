    <div class="title-text">Goal</div>
    <div>
        <p>Below are the goals of this project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Practice designing the whole website using HTML, CSS and Javascript without any frameworks or libraries.</li>
            <li>Create a website for TNDEV group to help group's apps and games reach more users, thus have more downloads and help the group have more income.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="content-wrapper screenshot-wrapper">
    <div class="title-text">Success Evaluation</div>
    <div>
        <p>The site's success will be evaluated based on the following metrics:</p>
        <div>
            <h3>1. Number of visitors and their sources</h3>
            <p>One of the site's goal is to attract more users to download the group's apps and games, so the number of visitors is key measure for the site's success.
            Along with the number of visitors, the source where the visitors come from is also important as it helps to know where is the main source that provide most of
            the users for the site. With this information, we can concentrate the marketing strategy to that specific source to attract even more users.
            Moreover, we can revisit the other sources which provide less user to investigate the reasons and can have strategies to improve the marketing
            on those sources.</p>
            <p>To help the site have more visitors, there are several methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Apply SEO techniques to the site so that it can appear on top of the search results of major
                search engines (Google, Bing). As most of the apps of TNDEV are about photo editing, the keywords for optimization will be: <strong>Photo Frames,
                    Photo Editor, Photo Collage.</strong></li>
                <li>Google Analytics: this is used to keep track of the sources where the users come from. It allows us to know if the users come from
                a search engine with a specific keyword, or if the users come from a social sites (Facebook, Twitter). These information will be useful
                for us to improve our marketing strategies.</li>
                <li>Google Adwords: we may need to spend some money to buy advertisements on the chosen keywords.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>2. CTA Click Through Rate</h3>
            <p>The CTA (Call-To-Action) on the site is the "Download on GooglePlay" button on every app's page. The Click Through Rate for this CTA
            is also an important metric for evaluating the site's success because the if users do not click on the button, they are not likely to
            download the app on GooglePlay. Therefore, the group's apps can not get more downloads.</p>
            <p>To keep track of the Click Through Rate, we can use Google Analytics. Google Analytics will record every click on the button.
            And based on the number of clicks, combined with the number of visitors we can calculate the Click Through Rate.</p>
            <p>If the Click Through Rates of
            the pages on the site are low, we have to review the site again to find the causes so that we can improve it. Some of the causes can be: the placement
            of the button is inappropriate, the content on the page is not attractive, etc.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>3. Average time on page</h3>
            <p>This is another measure of the site's success. The more time users stay on the pages, the more likely they find the apps interesting
            and click on the download button.</p>
            <p>Once again, this metric can be recorded using Google Analytics.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="title-text">Target Audience</div>
    <div>
        <div>
            <h3>1. Target Audience</h3>
            <p>There are a number of factors that can be used to recognize target audience for the web site:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>TNDEV makes apps and games for Android smartphones and tablets.</li>
                <li>Most of the apps are photo editing apps.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With the above 2 factors, we can say the target audience of the site is: <strong>teenagers or adults who have an Android smartphone
            or tablet, and like to take, edit, share photos with other people.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>2. Site design catering for target user group</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>As target users have a mobile device, the site has to be displayed well on mobile devices. Therefore, <strong>Responsive</strong> will be the first priority for designing the site.</li>
                <li>As target users like to edit and share photos, the site has to have beautiful icons, screenshots that can emphasize the apps' functions of creating beautiful photos.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
